### Part 2 (75 pts)

Given this ethical dilemma, first I would go up to my boss to make the problem known. If the decision is to delay the postponement then I would stop trying to get the word out and continue to fix the problem. But, if they decide to continue to push the release, I would continue up the chain of command trying to find someone who has enough power willing to postpone the release. If nothing happens and I get no response on the decision of the company, then I would give a final notice that I would take it to the public if the company doesn't decide to postpone the release. Then depending on their response, I would either continue to work or turn to the public and try to get the story out there. Although, I expect to be reprimanded or even fired because of my actions, to me it would be the ethical thing to release the information to the public. I think the farthest that someone should go would be to reveal the security problems to the public. Anything beyond that would be too much. If I did nothing, I would be responsible for any harm because I would know the problem and I did nothing to stop it from being released. Although, legally I might not be in trouble, ethically I would feel responsible.
