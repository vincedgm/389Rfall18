## Assignment 3 Writeup

### Part 1 (100 pts)
One vulnerability found was the weak passwords set. Passwords should not be common words or something that could be found on a wordlist. Although strong passwords are tough to remember, it is better to have a strong password that you have to write down somewhere or have a password manager manage than to be easily broken through with brute force. A strong password consists of at least 8 characters or longer with a random collection of uppcase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It is also bad to reuse passwords for different sites, so make sure to have unique passwords for everything.
Another vulnerability found was running an older OS for the website. By not updating the OS frequently, it will lead to problems down the road because by having an older version, there are more vulnerabilities and risks already found that have been fixed in the newest update. So, by not updating frequently, the vulnerabilities are already public knowledge and can be easily used to gain access to information and data.
A third vulnerability would be a lack of a firewall which makes sending and receiving information very easy. Without a firewall, there is no protection from outside computers. Outside computers are able to take advantage of this and are able to snoop around the network and discover data and information about the network such as exposed ports and data being sent out. Firewalls are also protection against various malicious software.
